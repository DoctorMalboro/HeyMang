ManGet
======

## The easiest way to download all your mangos ##

ManGet is a free, open-source project that allows you to get your manga from your favourite sites. Right now is at beta stage and so many features are not yet implemented and many sites have not been covered yet.

### Future features:
* RSS downloads
* Better image tagging
* Auto-update (only for stable branches)

### Future sites:
* Mangafox
* Batoto
* ExHentai
* E-Hentai
_(More to add, just pull a request in the git)_

Remember always to check the official git and to update the program as much as you can. Fork, pull requests and issue bugs, that always helps.

### Many thanks to:
    * Books authors such as: Learn Python the Hard Way, Python for begginers, Nettuts+, Python Docs, etc.
    * The libraries I've used: BeautifulSoup and PyQt4.
    * 4chan, specially /a/ for the idea and /g/ for the feedback.
    * StackOverflow for answering all of my questions.
    * Everyone who works and contributes to Python, a beautiful and excellent language!
